Two days later the Codamotion system arrived at the International Space Station aboard the Dragon resupply module and was successfully installed for use by Astronauts to study perceptual motor skills in microgravity.\r\n\r\nChanges in gravity can be considered as perturbations to the performances of dexterous task, which somehow can be compensated by our brain through adaptive control. Preliminary results performed during exposure in microgravity in parabolic flight show that the central nervous system is able to adapt to the lack of gravity. Scientists also put in evidence that the anticipation of gravity’s effect persists in the short term. Through a long-duration space flight, the scientist team want to understand how the central nervous system adapts to an environment without gravity and what the consequences of long-term adaptation when an individual returns to a normal gravitational field (Earth) are.\r\n\r\nThe system consists of 2 CX1 Units, specially modified according to the space station constraints. Markers will record the hand and arm movements, head position and orientation and the linear acceleration and rotational velocity of a manipulandum the subject is asked to use. Codamotion’s RTNet and SDK software has been incorporated into the mission’s main computer systems to perform the necessary experiments and to record and analyse data.\r\n\r\nWhat are the special modifications? The main modifications are to replace insulation materials to prevent outgasing in the vacuum of space, and protective coatings on circuit board components and on glass windows to prevent glass fragments floating away in zero-gravity in the case of accidental breakage. The basic construction of the system is exactly as we sell it as standard product. If it can withstand the knocks and bangs of a rocket launch and the severe heat cycling of a space mission, you know our system is going to perform reliably in your laboratory.",

These included ultrasound, radar, inertial devices, and video cameras, all of which were rejected as not meeting one or more of the above criteria. So a long odyssey began to find a method that would.\r\n\r\nBy the mid 1970s, a method was developed using solid-state injection lasers as the markers and a hybrid analogue/digital optical mask as the detection device within the cameras. It was also at this time that the concept of three high-resolution uni-axial cameras mounted on a rigid frame was devised. This enabled the system to be pre-calibrated to allow calculation of the 3-D co-ordinates, without the need for the user to carry out on-site calibration.\r\n\r\nThe first system was developed as a research instrument within Loughborough University, United Kingdom and achieved resolutions of 1 part in 4000 at a 1KHz sampling rate. It was not a commercial system and it was felt it did not attain high enough spatial resolution.",

It wasn’t until much later that this name morphed into ‘Codamotion’.\r\n\r\nThe prisms were automatically identified by colour using revolving polygonal mirrors as scanning devices. Beams of light were swept across the field of view by the mirrors. When a marker was briefly illuminated by the transiting beam it reflected a pulse of light back via the same mirror. The returning light pulse was detected via a complex set of fibre-optics and photodiode Prism detectors.\r\n\r\nResolutions of better than 1 in 50,000 (approx 0.2mm) at 300Hz sampling rate were achieved with CODA, a small number of which were produced commercially. While its spatio-temporal performance was far better than any other technique available at the time, it suffered from the limitation that only a maximum of 12 prism markers could be uniquely identified by colour.",

Previously, in the 1960s, David worked in the space industry in the USA.  By the 1970s he had moved back to his native UK, and his interest in movement analysis was borne of a desire to apply space-age technology to benefit societies here on Earth.\r\n\r\nHe was particularly interested in understanding human motor control systems for clinical applications, as well as artificial limb control system design.  But the frame-by-frame cine analysis of that era made this a cumbersome and painstaking task.  David felt there had to be a better way.\r\n\r\nDavid began by setting out some basic criteria for a movement analysis system, and it shows his foresight that these features are still widely regarded as the measure of a good system today.  These are: high spatial and temporal resolution and accuracy (sub millimetre and >200Hz),  automatic identification of markers, real-time output of co-ordinate data with millisecond latency, precalibration, ease-of-use, and portability.",
